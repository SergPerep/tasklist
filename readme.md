# Tasklist
[â†’ Deployed project on heroku](srgprp-tasklist.herokuapp.com/). Heroku needs some time to wake up its server and load the app, so be patient.

Want to try and test this app on your local machine? Follow [this setup guide](./setup/setup-guide.md) then.

## Features

- Adding, deleting and editing task
- Setting date and time for a task
- Setting project for a task
- Adding, deleting and editing project
- Setting name and color of a project
- Login and signup

## Data design
I've chosen postgreSQl since I worked with this database before end I needed relational database to connect tasks with projects and users.

### Folder table

- Folder is a customizable collection of tasks. 
- Folders are called projects in frontend only for the user convenience.

### Color table

- Contains collection of colors, which user can assign to a project (folder).
- Initially it had 2 additional columns with color-values. But after redesign they became deprecated.
- User is allowed to select color for a project but not to add new colors or remove any, since they are a part of UI design. 

### Users table

- Contains usernames and hashed passwords of registered users.
- User-sessions are stored separately in MongoDB.

### Task table

- Contains tasks with description, date and time and status of completion. Required to be connected to a user, and can be assigned to a folder.
- Initially instead of <code>date: date</code> and <code>time: time</code> were <code>date: timestamp</code> and <code>has_time: boolean </code>. <code>Date</code> stored information about both date and time and <code>has_time</code> indicated whether client should read hours and minutes of <code>date</code> or not. Such entries were hard to understand (by human). And since postgres has special types for days and hours anyway, it was decided to use such instead. Though it required some tweaks of node-postgres configuration to force it to work smoothly.
- <code>time_of_creation</code> is used only for task sorting.
- Originally table also had <code>last_time_was_updated</code> column but it was deprecated, since no use was found for it.

## Security

### Usernames instead of emails

The app utilizes usernames instead of emails for authentication so that user is able to proceed with the app without worrying about possible misuse of their personal information.

### Hashing passwords

The app doesn't store passwords in their original form. Each password goes through hashing with [bcrypt.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js) before entering database.
### Strong passwords

Library [zxcvbn by dropbox](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) checks passwords on signup page. It discourages people to use common passwords and accepts only those that are at least moderate strength.

### Sessions over tokens
The app uses session-cookies to remember users and grant them access to their own collection of projects and tasks. The token-based authentication methods were also considered but they seem less secure, more bulky and shine best in server-to-server interaction.

[Express-session module](https://github.com/expressjs/session) was used to implement sessions.
